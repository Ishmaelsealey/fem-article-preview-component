## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned that I should adequately plan a strategy for completing my challenge. It will help me predict any issues that I may come across, and it will keep me focused when I am putting it together.

I also learnt that I should try using a mobile first workflow with my website designs to make it easier to cater for responsive design.

### Continued development

I wish to focus on mobile first development as well as alternative ways of styling my pages.
While styling the article, I recognized that some of what I did was not great design, however I did not know any other way of doing it. I believe that I should research more ways of fulfilling the same task in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me figure out the different properties I could use in css to position objects where I wanted them.
